First, it can mean a supposition or a system of ideas intended to explain something, especially one based on general principles independent of the thing to be explained.

Second, a set of principles on which the practice of an activity is based: \"a theory of education\" and \"music theory\". Third, an idea used to account for a situation or justify a course of action: \"my theory would be that the place has been seriously mismanaged\".
