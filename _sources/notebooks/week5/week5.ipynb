Here's some examples of use cases:\n",

        "An useful quantity to describe a propagation phenomena in a network —virus, money, information,..— is the **amplification factor** $A$. If a virus in a node spread to all the adjacent nodes of that node, then the amplification —Assuming transmission between all nodes is bidirectional (undirected network)— is: $A = \\frac{<k^{2}>}{<k>} -1$ where <k> is the average degree of connectivity. \n",

        " - For A = 1, on the other hand, perturbations will be marginal spreading, where some will spread and others will “die-out”. In this case we need to have an average of 1 output per 1 input. This case will lead to a power law distribution of clusters size. \n",

This is useful therefore to know for example how many people we need to vaccinate to stop an epidemic or to build robust transportation or communication networks.\n",

The transfer matrix describe a diffusion process in a network. In a diffusion process we observed a continuous propagation of a given quantity —as opposed to the binary propagation in replication.\n",
