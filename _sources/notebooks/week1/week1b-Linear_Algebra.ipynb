Although we will not consider the implications of each requirement here, we provide the list for reference.\n",

The name given to the collection of all $n\\times 1$ arrays is known as Euclidean $n$-space, and is given the symbol $\\mathbb{R}^n$.  The required definitions of addition and scalar multiplication in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ are those described for matrices in [Matrix Algebra](Matrix_Algebra.ipynb).

    "Some of the most important applications of inner products involve finding and using sets of vectors that are mutually orthogonal.  A set of nonzero vectors $\\{U_1, U_2, U_3 ... U_n\\}$ is **mutually orthogonal** if $U_i\\cdot U_j = 0$ whenever $i \\neq j$.  This simply means that every vector in the set is orthogonal to every other vector in the set.  If a set of vectors is mutually orthogonal *and* every vector in the set is a *unit vector*, we say the set is **orthonormal**.  In other words, every vector in an orthonormal set has magnitude one, and is orthogonal to every other vector in the set.  \n",

    "Orthonormal sets must be linearly independent, so it makes sense to think of them as a basis for some vector subspace.  Any collection of vectors from the standard bases of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ are orthonormal sets.  For example, the set of vectors $\\{E_1, E_4, E_5\\}$ from the standard basis of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ forms a orthonormal basis for a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n",

If instead we have an orthonormal basis $\\alpha = \\{U_1, U_2, U_3 ... U_n\\}$ for $\\mathcal{V}$, there is a convenient shortcut to solving $X = b_1U_1 + b_2U_2 + ... b_nU_n$.
